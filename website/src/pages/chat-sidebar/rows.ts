/** The sidebar's row model: which rows pass the filters and in what order, which lane
 *  and folder each one lands in, and what each rendered row shows.
 *
 *  The list mixes two origins. A LOCAL row is this machine's slot; a PEER row is a live
 *  session a connected crew owns (`peer_id`), and its raw `key` can be byte-identical to
 *  a local one because the two gateways do not share a key namespace. Every piece of
 *  local sidebar state here (folder, pin, pinned rank, unread, running, recent, search
 *  rank, rename, reveal flash, digit badge, popped-out, sub-agent counts, the active
 *  slot) is indexed by LOCAL key. This module is where that state is read for a row, and
 *  it is read only after the one origin check in `localKeyOf`, so a peer row never
 *  carries another session's local state into a filter, a lane, a folder or a
 *  `SessionRowView`.
 *
 *  Pure: no React, no storage, no clock of its own (`clock` is injected). The facade
 *  calls `buildSidebarRows` on every render with the previous result; each memoized
 *  output (the lists, the lane populations, the order, the predicates, the reveal
 *  registry, the chip counts) keeps its identity while the inputs it reads are
 *  unchanged (the same `Object.is` test a `useMemo` dependency list applies), so an
 *  effect keyed on `filteredSlots` or a memo keyed on `laneOrder` re-runs only when that
 *  output can have changed. The result object, its `lanes` container, `staleSplit` and
 *  `views` are fresh per build: read their members, never key on them. */
