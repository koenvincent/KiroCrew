/**
 * Keeps a pinned folder header where it is when its folder collapses.
 *
 * A list-view folder header is `position: sticky` inside its folder block, so
 * while the block's top has scrolled above the lane the header is painted at
 * its pin offset, not at the block's top. Collapsing shrinks the block to the
 * header alone, which takes away the room the header was sticking in: with an
 * unchanged `scrollTop` the header lands at the block's top, above the lane,
 * and every row below jumps up by the distance scrolled into the folder.
 *
 * The fix is to move the BLOCK, not the header: before the body starts to
 * close, scroll the lane so the block's top sits exactly where the header is
 * painted. The header's natural position then equals its pinned one, so it
 * does not move at all, and the body closes underneath it with the next folder
 * or session rising to meet it. Measuring the painted offset (rather than
 * deriving it from the sticky `top` of each depth) keeps this correct for a
 * nested header pinned below its ancestors and for a header the block's end is
 * already pushing off the lane.
 *
 * WHEN it runs matters as much as how far. The scroll lands in the same commit
 * that marks the folder collapsed, before that frame paints: `FolderBody` hides
 * its rows in that commit. Scrolling earlier, in the click handler, would paint
 * at least one frame of the folder's FIRST rows under the header (the
 * optimistic collapse reaches React a few ticks after the click), so the rows
 * the person was looking at would swap for others before folding away.
 *
 * WHERE the header was painted is read at the click, not in that commit. With
 * motion on, the body's grid track is still at its open height in the
 * collapsed commit, so the header is still pinned there; under
 * `prefers-reduced-motion` the transition is zeroed, the body is already
 * closed, and the header has fallen back to the block's top. The block's own
 * top does not move as its body closes, so the click's header position less
 * the block's top in the collapsed commit is the same distance either way.
 *
 * HOW FAST the body closes follows from the hold. Once the lane has moved, an
 * animated close slides the folder's rows up past the still header and leaves
 * the lane under it empty until the next folder arrives. So a collapse that
 * starts from a pinned header takes the reduced-motion path for that one
 * commit: the body closes with no transition (`instantClose` on `FolderBody`),
 * and the session rows' layout projection is off, because Framer would
 * otherwise animate the next folder's rows up from where they sat below the
 * open body, hundreds of px away. The next folder and its rows are under the
 * header in the same frame. A header at its natural place keeps the animated
 * close: nothing scrolls, and the folder visibly folds shut below it.

 * animate again: the first frame is the one the collapse paints in, and only
 * the second callback is sure to run after it. Clearing it then cannot animate
 * anything, because the closed track is already at `0fr`. It is also cleared
 * by the next arm, by `disarm`, by a dropped arm (on a timer at
 * `HOLD_ARM_TTL_MS`, so it never waits on a later `folders` change), and by
 * that folder being seen open again however it was expanded.
