/**
 * The badge copy for each connection method, in its own module so it can be
 * type-bound to the shared presentation mapping and unit-tested without pulling
 * in the whole settings panel.
 *
 * Two deliberate choices:
 *
 * The keys are LITERAL here rather than read off the mapping. The key-reference
 * gate (`website/scripts/check-i18n-keys.mjs`) can only check a key it resolves
 * statically, and its dynamic-site baseline is ratchet-DOWN only — its own
 * comment says never to raise it — so `i18nT(presentation.labelKey)` would buy
 * one table at the cost of two unchecked keys.
 *
 * The table is typed `Record<PresentedConnectionMethod, …>`, so adding a
 * transport to the mapping without adding its copy is a TYPE error, caught by
 * `npm run typecheck` rather than only by a test that someone has to write.
