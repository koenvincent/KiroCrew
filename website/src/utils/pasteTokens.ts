 * token occurrence in text to its backing PasteBlock is by the block's stable
 * `id`, carried in the token as an ENTIRELY INVISIBLE run of zero-width code
 * points right after `#N` (see {@link encodeIdInvisible}). Every character of
 * the carried id is zero-width, so the token renders byte-for-byte as
 * `[ Paste #N · M lines ]` to the user — nothing of the id is visible — while
 * the regex still recovers a durable key. `seq` restarts at 1 once a send
 * clears the blocks, so it is a display number only, never the addressing key.
 *
 * Legacy tokens in the old `#N`-only form (no invisible id) are still resolved
 * by seq as a migration fallback, so sent transcripts, per-slot drafts and the
 * paste-draft store written before this change keep working.
 *
 * Seq numbers are stable once assigned — if the user deletes token #2 and
 * pastes again, the new block is assigned a fresh seq (max+1), not renumbered.
