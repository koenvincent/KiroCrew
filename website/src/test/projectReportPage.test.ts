/**
 * The `project-report` page's three HCI readings, driven rather than read.
 *
 * The page is a template the PYTHON package ships -- an inert body plus its own
 * script, which the gateway mints into a sandboxed frame. Its logic therefore has no
 * home in the backend suite, where no JS engine is reachable: the backend file beside
 * it pins what a regex can pin and says so. What is checked HERE is the behaviour --
 * the page's real script, in a real DOM, against the field bag the host hands it.
 *
 * Reading across to the package tree is this repo's own practice in the other
 * direction: `test_dashboard_frame.py` reads `widgetSrcdoc.ts` and
 * `CrewDynamicDashboard.tsx` to keep one policy in one place. Same reason both ways.
 *
 * Each case sets `window.kirocrew` the way the frame does, inserts the markup, and
 * runs the script. The markup goes in through `DOMParser`, whose parsed scripts stay
 * inert, so the page's script is lifted out and called -- which is also what makes a
 * case able to re-run it with a new bag.
