/**
 * "On watch" mark for a crewmate whose automation loop is active.
 *
 * A crewmate with a live monitor or goal loop on its own thread will act again
 * without anyone asking. This mark says only that: no nudge text, no cycle
 * count, no banner. It sits around the avatar as a faint accent ring with one
 * small dot orbiting it slowly.
 *
 * It must never read like the WORKING state, which animates the face itself and
 * shows the green presence dot bottom-right. So this mark uses the accent
 * colour, moves around the face rather than in it, and under
 * prefers-reduced-motion drops every motion for one static accent dot at the
 * top-right corner (the opposite corner from presence).
 *
 * It fades in and out as a loop starts or stops, so a change mid-glance does
 * not read as a glitch; under reduced motion it cuts straight.
 *
 * The host wraps the avatar in a `relative` box; this renders absolutely over
 * it and nothing when `on` is false. It is decorative (tooltip only): every
 * host shows the label as a visible word beside it, so assistive tech reads
 * that word once.
