/**
 * CrewmateLiveActivity — the one status line a crewmate's chat shows while its
 * turn runs: what the crewmate is doing right now (#18238).
 *
 * It sits in the footer column directly above the working indicator (the
 * ghost-pose carousel in `ChatFooter`), not in the transcript. That placement
 * is the point: a transcript row mounting and unmounting on every tool step
 * hopped the indicator up and down by a row each time. This line is ONE
 * fixed-height row, mounted for the WHOLE live turn, whose text swaps in place
 * — so the indicator under it never moves while the crewmate works.
 *
 * The text is the DM header pill's own reading (`useSlotActivity` →
 * `resolvePillActivity`, over the slot's live status record and the shared
 * `toolStatusLabel`), so the chat and the header name one moment the same way.
 * Words only: the ghost under the line already carries the motion, and a
 * second spinner read as a second "working" sign.
