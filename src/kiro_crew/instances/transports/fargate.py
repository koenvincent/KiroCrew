"""The ``fargate`` transport: an SSM port-forward aimed at an ECS task's turn API.

The child process is the same SSM port-forward the ``ssm`` transport spawns; what
differs is what sits at the other end. The task runs no Kiro Crew gateway, so two
operations that exist for every other transport do not exist here — minting a
dashboard token and restarting a remote gateway — and both are refused before a
command line is built rather than dispatched and failed remotely.
