"""The ``PeerTransport`` seam: one object per way of reaching a remote crew.

Every per-method decision the gateway makes about an instance — how to validate
its addressing, what child to spawn, whether there is a dashboard token to mint,
which diagnosis ladder to run, whether a remote restart exists — is answered by
the transport resolved from ``Instance.connection_method``, not by a conditional
at each call site. The manager keeps the lifecycle (locks, epochs, ports,
self-heal tiers); the transport answers only "how do I reach this peer".

Why a protocol and not a base class: two of the members a transport must answer
are *capabilities* rather than behaviour (``mints_token``, the timeout defaults),
and a protocol lets a future transport be a plain object that states them. The
one piece of genuinely shared behaviour — a transport whose reach is a supervised
child process forwarding a loopback port — lives in :class:`ChildForwardTransport`,
which all three shipped transports use.

The seam exists so a fourth transport is an addition rather than a fourth arm on
eighteen conditionals; the outbound-instance-transport RFC proposes the first one.
