"""The dynamic dashboard's frame: the host owns the document, the template owns the page.

A template's ``template.html`` is a body fragment and it may run JS. That is a
decided point of contract v3 and it is what makes a chart possible -- the host
cannot draw one for a template it has never seen, and a page that can only print
text cannot be a dashboard. So the fragment is treated the way dsh-visualize
treats a visualization: the page author writes the body, and the host writes
everything around it.

Two ways a value reaches the page, and the page chooses per element
------------------------------------------------------------------
1. ``data-dashboard-field="<name>"`` on an element: the host sets that element's
   TEXT to the field's value. No markup, no attributes, no HTML -- a text node, so
   a value can never become an element. This is the path for every cell a reader
   reads.
2. ``window.kirocrew.fields`` in a script: the same values as data, for a chart to
   draw from. :data:`WINDOW_GLOBAL` also carries ``agentic`` (the names the
   crewmate wrote rather than the gateway folded), ``seq`` (the fold watermark) and
   ``stale``.

The host fills (1) itself, from the same object it hands to (2), so a page cannot
show one number in a cell and a different one in its chart.

What the host refuses to let the page do
----------------------------------------
:data:`FRAME_CSP` closes egress (``connect-src 'none'``) and grants no dynamic-exec
primitive, over a frame the dashboard mounts with ``allow-scripts`` and nothing
else -- an opaque origin with no access to the dashboard's cookies, storage or DOM.
A fixed two-origin CDN allowlist carries Chart.js and D3 and can be used for
nothing else, because nothing can be sent to it.

Egress is closed harder here than a chat card needs it closed, and the reason is
what this page HOLDS: real numbers out of the operator's own crew log, including a
work ledger and a crewmate's mistake book. A page that can both read those and open
a channel is an exfiltration path with a data source attached.

Staleness and the agentic marker
--------------------------------
A field whose source did not resolve is reported, not guessed at. The page keeps
the last values that did resolve and the host shows a band saying the data is
stale -- a half-filled page is the one state a status surface must never reach,
because a reader cannot tell it from a current one. Agentic values are marked for
the same reason at a smaller scale: a number the crewmate asserted and a number the
log recorded are different kinds of claim, and a reader deciding whether to act on
one is entitled to know which it is looking at.

#: before they can trust the frame. Both entries carry the libraries a dashboard
#: actually needs (Chart.js, D3) and neither can be reached for egress:
#: ``connect-src`` is closed, so these origins serve scripts and nothing sends.
#:
#: PINNED EQUAL to the browser wrapper's own ``script-src`` list in
#: ``website/src/lib/widgetSrcdoc.ts``. The two policies intersect, so an origin
#: named only here is still blocked and the page fails to load its chart library

#:   neither (the browser wrapper's own policy already withholds them and says so),

#:
#: ``'unsafe-inline'`` stays on script and style: inline markup and inline script

#: paint is a chart that draws nothing or, worse, invents a placeholder.
#:
#: The FILL therefore runs on ``DOMContentLoaded`` rather than immediately: the
