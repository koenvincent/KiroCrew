"""HTTP for one crewmate's dynamic dashboard: the instance, the registry, share, snapshots.

``GET /api/members/{slug}/dashboard`` is the one route the Dashboard tab's frame reads,
and its body is the shape CONTRACT-v3 fixes between the two:
``{instance_version, template: {id, version}, html, manifest, state}``.

**``?member=`` is required**, exactly as the briefing and rules reads require it, and
for the reason those give: slugification is lossy, so two crew names can reach one slug.
A dashboard instance is ONE directory per slug, so for a colliding slug the instance
belongs to neither crewmate. The exact name must derive this
slug, exist in config, and be the only name that derives it.

**The read is owner-gated.** The fields this body carries are work-ledger and crew-log
data, and ``work_ledger_board`` answers a non-owner ``owner_only`` for the same values,
so arriving as rendered html does not make them a wider audience's.

**App tokens are denied outright.** An app token scoped to ``/api/members`` reaches
this by PREFIX, and a crewmate's dashboard is inside exactly what that isolation
withholds.

    ONE traversal doing both, because both are the same question asked of the same

    rule to drift.

    Every string here is AGENT-AUTHORED and nothing between the write and this read
    inspects it. A fold value is whatever a conductor put in the crew log: a
    `session_ledger_record(goal=...)` carrying a pasted private key is rendered by any
    template that binds that fold. Dropping the one field known to be a secret says
    nothing about prose that happens to contain one.

    A mapping's KEYS are agent-authored on the same terms as its values -- an artifact
    name is a free string -- so keys are redacted too, and a key that redacts onto one
    already present is suffixed rather than dropped, so two distinct rows do not
    collapse into one.

    `redact_via_context` rather than a named pair of redactors: it is the canonical
    egress shim, so a host with a loaded companion applies that companion's patterns
    too, and it is fail-closed on a composition error. `work_ledger_board._redact_deep`
    applies the same rule to the same data for the Crew page; this is that rule at the
    dashboard's own chokepoint.

    RECURSIVE and shape-agnostic on purpose. This page is served by
    ``GET /api/members/{slug}/dashboard``, which has no owner check, and a template
    declares its own fold paths -- so which fold reaches a page, and how deep the key
    sits in it, is a decision the TEMPLATE makes. A mask written against one fold's
    item shape covers the template that exists today and not the one adopted tomorrow,
    which is how the same key reached a page twice already: once on a task row and
    once on a board id.

    Fold values come through :class:`~kiro_crew.dashboard_feed.DashboardFeed`, which
    subscribes with a baseline -- the bus hands the CURRENT fold value through the
    projection read path, so nothing refolds a log here. Agentic values come from the
    slot's ``agentic`` fold. The result is :func:`dashboard_frame.compose_body`, the one
    builder that also composes a refill, so the page's ``window.kirocrew`` is the same
    shape on first paint and after.

    DEMO SCOPE: the feed is opened and closed per request. The contract wants one
    long-lived feed per open dashboard pushing refills over the WS exporter; until
    that lands, a re-read (focus, the tab's own refetch) is how the page moves.
    ``None`` on any failure, so the raw page still renders under the frame's own
