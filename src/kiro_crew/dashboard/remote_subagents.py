"""Run managed subagents on connected remote Kiro Crew instances.

The local gateway remains the control plane: it chooses a connected instance,
starts one silent peer run through the existing authenticated instance tunnel,
and polls that run until it reaches a terminal state.  The peer owns execution
and resource use; the local :class:`SubagentManager` owns the visible record and
parent-result delivery.

No peer credential crosses this module.  Every request goes through
``SshTunnelManager.proxy_request``, which adds the port-scoped owner cookie and
performs its bounded re-mint retry.
