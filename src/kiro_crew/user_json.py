"""Parse JSON from a config file a person may have saved by hand.

MCP configs (``~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json``, Kiro Crew's own ``mcp.json``, a
project's ``.kiro/settings/mcp.json``, ``~/.mcp.json``), the agent specs that
carry ``mcpServers``, Kiro Crew's ``agent.json`` overrides, ``~/.claude.json``
and a project's Claude settings are edited by people, and Windows editors save
UTF-8 "with BOM" by default. That file is valid UTF-8 whose first character is
U+FEFF, which is not content, and ``json.loads`` refuses it ("Unexpected UTF-8
BOM"). Every reader of such a file parses through :func:`loads_user_json` so one
leading mark is dropped the same way everywhere. A reader that hands
``json.loads`` the undecoded bytes needs nothing: its encoding detection already
drops the mark.

Only reading changes. Writers keep emitting ``json.dumps`` text, so a file read
here and written back comes out as plain BOM-free UTF-8.

The module imports nothing from the package, so any layer can use it.
