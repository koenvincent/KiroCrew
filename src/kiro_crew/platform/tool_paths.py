"""Shared, bounded, depth-aware extraction of a tool call's target file paths.

This module is the SINGLE source of the traversal that both the sensitive-path
keystone in :mod:`kiro_crew.hooks` (hard-deny plane) and the governance
intersection plane in :mod:`kiro_crew.platform.governance` (permit-by-default
plane) rely on. It lives BELOW both on purpose: ``hooks`` imports FROM
``platform.governance``, so ``governance`` cannot import ``hooks`` without a
cycle, and both need the same walk. Keeping it here — and depending on nothing
but the stdlib and :mod:`collections.abc` — lets either caller import it with no
cycle and no heavy transitive dependency.

The two callers apply DIFFERENT fail semantics to the ``truncated`` flag (the
keystone hard-denies an unverifiable scan; governance denies only the scopes the
tool kind implies, per its permit-by-default contract), but the extraction
itself is identical and must not drift between them.

    Nesting is walked for the same ground-truth reason: a batch-shaped tool
