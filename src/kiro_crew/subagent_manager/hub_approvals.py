"""Tool approvals a floored run hands back to the remote hub that placed it.

A run carries ``approval_floor="interactive"`` only when a remote hub placed it
and the hub's own posture for that child is not auto. The person who may answer
is in the hub's session, not on this crew's dashboard, so the permission ladder
parks each request here instead of prompting locally. The hub reads the pending
requests from the run's status (``GET /api/spawn/{id}``), asks its person, and
answers through ``POST /api/spawn/{id}/approvals/{approval_id}``.

Nothing here is persisted: a pending request lives only as long as the turn
that raised it, and an unanswered one is a rejection when its wait runs out.
