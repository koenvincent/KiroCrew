"""runner_watchdog.py -- unstick CI runs whose CodeBuild-routed jobs lost their runner.

Driven by ``.github/workflows/ci-runner-watchdog.yml``; stdlib only.

The failure mode
----------------
``ci.yml`` routes some Linux jobs to an AWS CodeBuild-hosted runner through a
per-run label, ``codebuild-<project>-<run_id>-<run_attempt>``. CodeBuild starts
one ephemeral just-in-time runner per ``workflow_job.queued`` webhook, and that
runner registers a broker session before it can take the job. The session
handshake is not reliable: when the broker fails the first ``CreateSession`` call
after having half-created the session server-side, every retry is refused with
"a session for this runner already exists", and the runner gives up after a
hard-coded few minutes -- shorter than the ghost session's server-side expiry.
The runner process exits cleanly, CodeBuild records the build as SUCCEEDED, and
nothing ever retries: the label is specific to this run attempt, so no other
runner can pick the job up, and ``timeout-minutes`` does not apply to a job that
was never started. The job sits *queued* until GitHub's own multi-hour pending
limit, the run stays *in_progress*, and on ``main`` -- whose concurrency group
does not cancel in-progress runs -- every later push is held pending behind it
and then evicted by the next push. One orphaned shard blocked verdicts on
``main`` for ten hours.

What this script does
---------------------
Lists ``queued``, ``in_progress`` and ``pending`` runs REPO-WIDE -- one paginated
``GET /repos/{repo}/actions/runs?status=…`` per status returns runs of every
workflow at once -- and keeps only those whose ``path`` names a workflow that
routes jobs to the CodeBuild fleet (``WATCHED_WORKFLOWS`` -- the label
``codebuild-kirocrew-gha`` reaches ``ci.yml``, ``fast-gate.yml``,
``main-ratchet-audit.yml``, ``build.yml`` and eleven others). One listing per
status covers the whole watched set, and covers strictly more than a
per-workflow loop would: a fleet-routed workflow nobody registered is still
returned, and dropped only because it is not watched. It then reads each kept
run's jobs and calls a run ORPHANED when at least one job is still ``queued``,
carries a ``codebuild-`` label, and has waited longer than
``Policy.orphan_after`` (15 minutes). CodeBuild's measured queue-to-start on this
repository is under a minute, so a quarter of an hour is far outside any
legitimate wait. For each orphaned run, oldest first across every watched
workflow and at most ``Policy.max_runs`` (5) per invocation as one global cap,
it cancels the run, waits for the cancellation to land, then
re-runs it. The re-run creates a new run attempt, which produces fresh
``workflow_job.queued`` webhooks and a fresh runner label.

The watched set is a fixed tuple, not read from disk, and it is a client-side
FILTER on the repo-wide listing rather than a set of endpoints to poll: a
workflow that gains a fleet route without being added here goes unhealed even
though the listing returns it, and a workflow that loses one is still filtered in
harmlessly. A test pins the tuple to the set of workflows whose ``runs-on``
actually routes to the fleet, and pins ``ci-runner-watchdog.yml`` out of it --
its own comment names the label, and a watchdog that cancelled and re-ran itself
would never finish a tick.

A GitHub rate limit is survivable, not fatal. A 403 or 429 whose body names a
rate limit is honoured against its ``Retry-After`` / ``X-RateLimit-Reset`` with
one cheap in-budget retry; when the reset is too far off, the tick stops
gathering, acts on the runs it has already classified, and records an
``aborted-rate-limited`` outcome that the summary names. A tick that classified
nothing exits nonzero because it has no health evidence; a partly productive
one exits zero and lets the next tick re-list. Every other
status -- 401, 404, 5xx -- and every malformed payload still raises exactly as
before.

The re-run is a FULL re-run, not ``rerun-failed-jobs``, because of how the
label is computed: ``ci.yml`` computes it ONCE, in its ``changes`` job, and the
routed jobs read it from that job's outputs. A failed-jobs re-run does not run
``changes`` again, so the re-queued jobs would carry a label whose attempt
suffix is stale, and CodeBuild's documentation does not say whether it honours
that. A full re-run recomputes the label. The cost is one CI round; the
alternative was a ten-hour hold.

Slow is not dead
----------------
A ``codebuild-`` job queued past the threshold is also what CodeBuild account
concurrency saturation looks like, and cancelling and re-running saturated runs
would only add to the contention. The two are told apart by what the OTHER
routed jobs are doing -- counting only starts AFTER the orphaned job queued,
because a fleet that was dispatching before the orphan queued says nothing
about the fleet it is waiting on (the onset of an outage looks exactly like
that). When a CodeBuild job that did get a runner started in that window after
waiting a long time (a third of the orphan threshold or more), CodeBuild is
dispatching slowly and every queued job is presumed alive; the tick reports the
runs as ``saturated`` and heals nothing. When such starts were prompt -- the
normal case, measured in seconds on this repository -- a job that has waited a
quarter of an hour is not in any queue, and is healed. When NOTHING has started
on CodeBuild since the orphan queued (live runs first, then the newest
completed runs), the evidence is inconclusive: from the queued side a
total fleet outage looks exactly like an orphan, and cancelling and re-running
into an outage only discards finished work. The tick holds, says so, and points
at the documented rollback.

Mutations are verified after the fact
-------------------------------------
The API offers no conditional cancel or re-run, so each mutation is bracketed:
the cancel is verified against one attempt beforehand and, once it lands, the
run's attempt and conclusion are read back (a run that finished on its own is
left with its verdict; a run somebody re-ran in the gap is re-run again so
nothing is lost). Every re-run is preceded by a newest-of-branch check and followed by
another after a short settle. If a newer run of the branch
(same head repository -- the listing matches branch NAMES, and forks share
them) appeared in that window the re-run is cancelled, its cancellation is waited
out, and the newer run is read until it reaches a terminal state or the settle
window closes: a cancelled successor is re-run in its place, through the same
bracketed re-run, so a run landing in ITS window is restored in turn (two
levels deep at most) -- unless a yet-newer run has taken the branch over, in
which case that run carries the verdict; one that finished any other way is
left alone. One still running when the window closes is never called settled
(a group cancel can land late); it is a failed outcome (the tick goes red and
names it) rather than a guess. The
branch lookup itself is paged until the run being judged is found and fails
closed if it is not, and a re-run refusal the run's own state does not explain
(nobody else re-ran it) is a failed outcome too.

Healing keeps ownership of what it cancelled
--------------------------------------------
The verdict is re-derived from a fresh read of the run and its jobs immediately
before the cancel, and the cancel is only sent if the SAME attempt is still
orphaned. A human who re-ran the run by hand between the listing and the heal
has moved it to a new attempt, and that attempt is left alone.

Once a cancel is accepted the script owns that run until it has been re-run:
it polls every cancelled run until it reports ``completed``, escalates to
``force-cancel`` when a plain cancel has not landed after
``Policy.force_cancel_after`` (90 seconds; a job still executing an ``always()``
step can hold a cancel open for minutes), and re-runs each run the moment it
completes. If the shared ``Policy.heal_budget`` (5 minutes) is exhausted first,
the run is reported as an error and left for the NEXT tick's recovery pass. The
whole invocation runs inside ``Policy.tick_budget`` (9 minutes): a re-run, whose
verification can take up to ``RERUN_RESERVE_SECONDS`` when a newer run lands in
its window and has to be restored, is begun only while that much remains, so
the workflow's ``timeout-minutes`` (set above the budget) never interrupts one
half-way; a re-run that cannot start in time is reported as an error and left
for the recovery pass,
which looks at recently *cancelled* runs (within ``Policy.recovery_window``,
90 minutes), obeys the same saturation/outage hold as the live pass, recognises
the orphan shape on their cancelled jobs (a ``codebuild-`` label, no runner
name, queued past the threshold when cancelled), and re-runs them only when
they are still the newest run of their branch. This makes the pass safe for a
pull-request run superseded by a newer push.

Guard rails
-----------
* A run younger than ``Policy.orphan_after`` is never actionable; its jobs are still
  read, because a slow start inside it is saturation evidence (above).
* Immediately before every re-run, the run must still be the newest run of
  its branch and event; otherwise it is reported for a human.
* A run whose head repository is a fork is reported but never touched: forks
  are never routed to CodeBuild, and the workflow token could not re-run them.
* A run at ``Policy.max_attempt`` (3) or beyond is reported but never touched. Every
  intervention bumps the attempt, so this bounds the number of automatic
  interventions per run and stops a run that keeps orphaning from being
  cancelled and re-run forever.
* A cancel the API refuses, or a re-run it refuses (typically 403 when someone
  re-ran it by hand first), is logged and skipped.
* When CodeBuild is observed dispatching slowly (above), nothing is healed.
* A run in the group with ZERO jobs is *waiting on its concurrency group*, not
  orphaned: cancelling it would only lose that push's verdict. It is reported so
  the summary explains what is holding it, and the blocking run is what gets
  healed.

``--dry-run`` performs every read and no write. The exit status is 1 when any
heal ran out of budget or a superseding run could not be restored, so the
workflow run goes red and names the run.

    Pull-request runs are covered as well as pushes: a heal whose cancel
    outlives the budget leaves the run ``cancelled`` with nobody to re-run it,
    and that is exactly the case this pass exists for. The fingerprint is what
    keeps it from resurrecting a human's deliberate cancel: it requires a
    cancelled ``codebuild-`` job that never had a runner and had queued past the
    orphan threshold, which a healthy run a human stopped never shows. A human
    who cancels an orphaned run and walks away gets that run re-run once
    (twice at most, by the attempt cap), which is the same thing a heal would
    have done.

    The dispatch hold the live pass obeys does NOT apply here, deliberately.
    That hold protects finished work: cancelling a half-done run into an
    outage discards it. A cancelled orphan has nothing left to discard -- its
    verdict is already lost, and only a re-run can bring it back. Re-running
    into saturation merely queues it; re-running into an outage leaves it
    queued until the fleet returns, which is strictly better than cancelled,
    and if it orphans again the live pass (attempt cap included) takes over.
    Holding it instead would let the recovery window expire under a long
    outage and abandon the run silently, which is the one unrecoverable path.
