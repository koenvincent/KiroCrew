"""Builtin-skill sync safety invariants.

``_ensure_builtin_skills`` may only destroy a destination directory it can
PROVE it installed and that has not changed since: a full-tree fingerprint
recorded in a ``.builtin-skill-provenance`` dotfile, verified after the
directory is atomically claimed. Everything else is user data: on update it
moves aside to a non-clobbering dot-prefixed ``.<name>.user-backup`` quarantine
(hidden from discovery, contents untouched), and the
stale-cleanup pass leaves it alone entirely.

The invariants under test: a name collision with a builtin never deletes a
user-authored tree, an in-place edit or user-added file marks a destination
diverged, a user skill named after a stale-cleanup entry survives startup,
legitimate updates of untouched builtins still happen, quarantines never
clobber each other, and verification can never hang or read unbounded bytes
on the startup path.
