"""Agent-spec home isolation — the KIRO_HOME seam, the worktree guard, and the
anti-regression guard that keeps ``~/.kiro/agents`` from being hard-coded again.

Regression context: a gateway booted from a linked git worktree rewrote the
machine-wide ``~/.kiro/agents/*.json`` on startup, stamping its own ``.venv``
binary into every managed server's ``command`` and its own data home into their
``env``. The real install's MCP servers then ran the worktree's code and read the
worktree's credential while still calling the live gateway, so every managed MCP
call returned HTTP 403 — and once the worktree was removed those specs pointed at
paths that were gone.

# One hard-coded ``Path.home() / ".kiro" / "settings" / "mcp.json"`` looks like
# two questions -- the servers a rebuild MERGES into the specs it writes, and
# the restrictions a session reads -- and it is tempting to isolate the first
# because it has no writer. It cannot be isolated: the same read also carries
# the per-server mute, whose writer resolves a fixed home, so a split reads an
# operator's switch-off as absent. This test holds the whole registry to the
# file its writer writes.

    no writer is safe to isolate. It is not: the same read supplies the
    per-server ``disabled`` mute, whose writer is the dashboard's fixed
    ``Path.home()`` registry. Isolated, the mute reads as absent, the rebuild
    pops ``disabled`` from the rendered entry and re-appends the server to
    ``allowedTools`` -- the list that never reaches the PreToolUse gate -- so an
