"""The ``project-report`` built-in's own rule: the epic tree and what it rolls up.

The generic built-in cases already resolve this template's fold paths and load its
manifest. What has no home there is the thing this page is FOR -- it draws the board
list as a four-level tree and states a number for every node -- and two of those
properties can be wrong with every other gate green.

**The roll-up.** A task row of the ``workstreams`` fold reports the WHOLE spend of the
worker session bound to it, which is that fold's own posture: that is what the task
cost to run. One session bound to two tasks therefore appears twice at the same amount,
so a tree that ADDED its rows up would bill that session once per task it served --
the error the fold explicitly refuses to make in a board total. A page contradicting
the fold about the same money is worse than a page without the number, because the
reader has no way to tell which of the two is the record.

**The subtask link.** A nested board arrives as a SIBLING row with a ``parent``, not as
a child, so a page that ignored the link would draw every sub-board as a root of its
own: the same work twice, once under its task and once beside its epic.

No JS engine is reachable from pytest, so the page's own drawing is evidence only
through ``scripts/render_dashboard_builtin.py``. What is checked here is (1) the
template's source, for the rules a regex can actually pin, and (2) the SAMPLE fixture
those renders are taken from -- because a fixture that stopped exercising nesting or
the shared-worker case would leave the screenshots green and prove nothing. The second
is the one that keeps the first honest: a source pin with no data behind it is a
spelling test.
