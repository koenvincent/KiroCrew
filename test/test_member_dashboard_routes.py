"""The crewmate dynamic dashboard HTTP routes (CONTRACT-v3 parts 4, 7 and "adopt").

The property worth guarding hardest is the one the sibling member routes already guard
and this surface adds a write to: WHICH crewmate's dashboard a request reaches is
decided from the slug plus the exact crew name, and a slug two crews share reaches
nobody's. An instance is one directory per slug, so serving a shared slug -- with an
editor -- would let two crewmates overwrite each other's dashboard.
