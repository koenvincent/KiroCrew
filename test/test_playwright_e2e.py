"""Dashboard Playwright E2E suite, folded into ``test_e2e`` (E2eTestCommand).

Boots a real gateway via the same ``spawn_feature_gateway`` harness the smoke
suite uses, then runs the credential-less, crash-free Playwright spec set
(``website/playwright``) against it. Uses Playwright's own bundled Chromium
(``playwright install`` at website-setup time); this OSS fork does not vend a
browser binary.

Gating:
  * ``KIROCREW_E2E`` (set by E2eTestCommand) lifts the skipif, same as the
    smoke suite.
  * Skips gracefully when the in-tree ``website`` dir or its Playwright CLI
    can't be resolved (e.g. a python-only checkout without the built frontend
    dependency).

# did not run. An exit code alone cannot catch that, so assert the count.
#
# Every dark spec that was later un-darkened had ALSO rotted -- stale selectors
# for UI that had moved -- because nothing exercised them. That is the argument
# for a floor rather than a periodic audit.
