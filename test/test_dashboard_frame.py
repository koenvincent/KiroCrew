"""The frame: what a template's page must be, and what the minted document grants.

A template's `template.html` is an inert body, never a document. This file pins
both halves of that: `validate_page` refuses anything that is already a document
or is too large, and `compose` mints the body into a page whose own policy closes
egress while allowing the page's script to run.

Kept apart from the write path's tests because the frame knows nothing about who
filled a field -- it draws whatever payload it is handed.
