"""A scripted gateway for ``kirocrew spawn``'s CLI tests.

``kirocrew spawn`` talks to the gateway through ``owner_gateway_client``: it mints
an owner token over the dashboard unix socket, then sends its calls there. This
fake stands in for that socket. Each request takes the next answer from
``script`` (a dict is the JSON reply, an exception is raised), and is recorded in
``calls`` with the socket path and the peer check it was opened with. TCP use
fails the test.
