"""The apps-dir walk and the instances-registry writes stay off the event loop.

``list_apps()`` walks the apps directory and reads two files per installed app;
``InstancesRegistry``'s write methods each read then atomically rewrite
``instances.json`` with an fsync. Neither belongs on the asyncio event loop:
the loop runs callbacks one at a time, so a synchronous filesystem call inside
an ``async def`` delays every other task (including the watchdog heartbeat) for
its duration. These are bounded, latency-class costs — not stall-class — but
the repo convention is to offload them via ``asyncio.to_thread``.

Two enforcement tiers:

- Behavior tests: drive each async entry point with a recording double and
  assert the filesystem-touching call executed on a worker thread, not the
  loop thread. Reverting an offload makes the recorded thread equal the loop
  thread and fails the test.
- AST ratchet: no direct (non-offloaded) call of the walk / registry-write
  functions may appear lexically inside an ``async def`` frame of the owning
  modules, so a future call site cannot silently regress. A nested ``def`` /
  ``lambda`` is a separate frame (the offloaded callable itself) and is not
  scanned, matching the scoping of ``test_no_blocking_call_on_loop.py``.
