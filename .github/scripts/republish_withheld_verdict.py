"""Re-run the advisory review lane(s) whose withheld verdict never reached a PR.

A whole-design review lane -- Design, UX, First Principles -- can compute a
verdict for the current head and fail to publish it, because the lane's shared
comment-write primitive refuses to overwrite a comment slot an earlier head
still occupies. The lane completes ``success`` and reports honestly that it
published nothing, the verdict is retained as a workflow artifact, and PR
Readiness scores the lane as a NAMED PENDING -- ``(verdict not published,
re-run this lane)`` -- rather than passed. Without a re-run of the lane the
pull request reads as unreviewed for its own head until a human intervenes.

This script is that recovery, driven by ``pr-readiness-sweep.yml``. The sweep is
the right engine for it -- it already holds ``actions: write``, runs on a 5-minute
schedule, and is the existing self-healing re-fire path for the analogous
dropped-readiness-signal case -- and it hands each withheld-verdict PR here.

Why RE-RUN the lane rather than replay the retained artifact: replaying a stored
verdict into a slot would re-open the exact authority question the write
primitive's refusal exists to answer (on what grounds may a run replace the
comment that is there?). Re-running the lane instead recomputes a fresh verdict
and publishes it through the SAME guarded upsert, which already resolves that
question correctly -- it replaces an occupant left by an OLDER head, and stands
down when the slot already holds a verdict for the current head. So the recovery
adds no new trust surface; it only re-drives the mechanism that already exists.

Which lanes are owed is decided by ``pr_status.py --disposition-gate``'s
``unpublished`` array -- the one ``evaluate_reviewer_markers`` predicate that
both PR Readiness and the local ``pr_status.py`` gate answer from, so this
script cannot disagree with either about whether a head is reviewed. It is
scoped to the three whole-design advisory lanes by construction: the required
lanes (Opus, GPT, Security Scope) fail CLOSED on a withheld verdict and are
recovered by their own check-run finalize, never read as a stale ``success``.

Self-terminating: once a re-run republishes, the lane leaves ``unpublished`` and
PR Readiness drops the ``[verdict-unpublished]`` token the sweep gated on, so the
next sweep does not re-fire it. A lane whose re-run is already in flight has an
``in_progress`` check-run, which PR Readiness scores ``(not started)`` -- again
no token -- so the window between dispatch and republish re-fires nothing.

Run-location follows the two review paths, exactly as the human-override handler
(``ai-review-human-override.yml``) locates a lane to re-run:
  * SAME-REPO: the lane runs on ``pull_request`` for this head, found by its
    workflow file + head SHA, bound to this PR by (head repo, head ref).
  * FORK: the lane runs via ``workflow_run`` from the default branch, so no run
    query by the PR head finds it. The lane writes its own run id into the
    check-run it posts on the head, as ``<!-- ai-review-fork-lane run=<id> -->``
    in ``output.text``; that marker is read back from the head's check-runs.

Nothing here is fatal to the sweep. Every failure to re-run one lane is reported
and the script moves on; the sweep tries again on its next tick.
